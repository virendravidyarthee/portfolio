const btSerialShortDescription = "This was a very abstract project by one of our clients who mostly didn’t share the use cases and business logic with us. All in all, it was an app that was used for serial port communication via bluetooth. All the commands and low level hardware based functionality was masked by a user friendly GUI.";

export const myWorkSubtitle = "Working at a service based company allowed me to work on numerous projects. I’m not going to list all of them here, but I’ll list a few interesting/challenging ones. All of these are enterprise apps so they aren’t available to the general public and even if they are, the credentials to use them won’t be. But hey, if you can pull some strings with the right companies and have some time then feel free to run them on your own device.\n\n" +

    "Disclaimer: I developed these projects while working for a company, so I am in no way trying to say that I have full ownership (legally and ethically, I can’t say that) of the said projects. I am merely stating the fact that I have made contributions to these projects. Which is a fair point.\n"+

const eeFullDescription = "There used to be a time when ExtraaEdge used to be available on the playstore but it has since been taken down as the owning company couldn’t successfully convince the playstore moderators as to why the app needed access to a user’s call logs and sms inbox. Which were unfortunately one of the app’s core features. The app is now being distributed via a custom website as a direct APK download.\n" +
    "ExtraaEdge is a lead management platform for very well known Institutions in India like IIT, Sinhgad, K11 and many more. Their platform is used by these institutions to maximise the transition of cold lead to hot leads and thus improving admission stats. The features provided by the platform are:\n" +
    "- Lead specific notes and remarks.\n" +
    "- Counselor location tracking and analytics.\n" +
    "- Call recording for registered leads.\n" +
    "- Automated lead communication.\n" +
    "- Smart caller IDs.\n" +
    "- Weekly, monthly, yearly stats.\n" +
    "- Geofencing.\n" +
    "- Maps integration.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Their full solution included a web app and Android and iOS apps. Where I was the incharge of developing and maintaining the Android and iOS apps. The project was very challenging as the app was heavily customisable and dynamic for specific counselors or institutions. A lot of dynamic layouts were employed for the specific client use cases. The most challenging part however was maintaining and extending the thousands of lines of legacy code behind the application.\n";

const btSerialFullDescription = "Internally called Central Control Unit (CCU) is borderline IoT based project where a mobile device or a tablet is used to send and receive serial commands via Bluetooth and control a group of machines. The app is a strict enterprise app and access is granted only to the clients of the owning authorities.\n" +
    "This app is designed for factory settings where it can be used to control a group of industrial printers with all sorts of commands ranging from daily operations to self testing. The app masks all the hardware level commands with a modern GUI where the user doesn’t have to worry about entering the right and often tedious serial port commands. It is also to be noted that the app was made to be modular from the very get go. As the app’s functionality was also later modified to be able to work with a school PA system with bluetooth speakers.\n" +
    "The most tedious part of development in this project was the actual bluetooth interface and how to gracefully handle exceptions. Another area where keen observations were required was being able to handle the analog bluetooth devices that would be paired with the phone. They tend to throw a lot of exceptions when the app is trying to establish communications with them.\n";

const idealFullDescription = "Ideal10 is a study companion app that allows grade 10 students in India to keep a copy of their syllabi in their smartphones. It is a fairly simple app with login and content delivery functionalities. The app is developed in association with Ideal Publications Inc. \n" +
    "The project does include pretty eye catchy and animations and being a content delivery system, strong emphasis was put on the UX part of the app.\n" +
    "The app also included a pretty interesting take on offline data persistence using Room and RxJava.";
